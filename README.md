# bower-experiment

Shows that Bower users can mostly use unpkg.com to get their packages

Installed dependencies comitted for review and for GitHub Pages.

With Bower, dependencies may be specified as simple http files, so you can use unpkg.com.

Specify an effective version range in the url like, e.g. https://unpkg.com/sweetalert2@7.x.x,
and use the file path from the url that it redirects you to, e.g.
https://unpkg.com/sweetalert2@7.x.x/dist/sweetalert2.all.js, so the file will have the
correct `.js` extension
